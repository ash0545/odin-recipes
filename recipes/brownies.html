                <li> 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
                <li> 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips </li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

                <li>Combine sugar, melted butter, and vanilla in a large bowl.
